Regressions on COVID-19 Vaccination Rates
In the United States only 60% of citizens are vaccinated, and the vaccination rate has plateaued. Social scientists and statisticians are now trying to discover potential reasons someone might choose not to get vaccinated. With this code I explore the very same question: what might cause someone not to get vaccinated? There are plenty of potential reasons, one being distrust of the vaccine and the spread of misinformation which primarily relies on one’s political orientation. Statisticians however are also exploring other potential rationales such as a person's education level leading to higher rates of vaccination, or a subject's type of work, and income, all of which affect one's individual decision making. 

Another reason that should be explored is that those who remain unvaccinated have already had COVID and consider themselves immune, thus deciding they no longer need the vaccine. This code will explore the rationale mentioned above; whether having had covid affects one’s decision to get vaccinated. It is possible that after having COVID a subject no longer feels the need to get vaccinated as their immune system has already built up protection against COVID and they no longer see a reason to get the COVID-19 vaccine.
